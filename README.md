- 👋 Hi, I’m @dskow
- 👀 I’m interested in creating mobile and dekstop apps and openapis that interface server endpoints that don't have any matching public clients that match the endpoints.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more ways to use the autogenerated openapi code and learning ios ui features.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something cool.
